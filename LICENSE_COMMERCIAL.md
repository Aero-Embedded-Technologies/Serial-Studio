This Commercial License Agreement (the "Agreement") is a legally binding contract between you (the "Licensee") and Alex Spataru (the "Licensor") governing the use of the official, precompiled versions of *Serial Studio* (the "Software").

## 1. Grant of License

Upon purchase of a valid Serial Studio license and successful activation, the Licensor grants you a **non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license** to use the Software for commercial purposes, subject to the terms of this Agreement.

This license **only applies to the official precompiled binary**. It does **not** grant any rights to the source code, which is governed by a separate license (GPLv3 and Commercial License terms).

## 2. Permitted Uses

With a valid commercial license, you may:

- Use the Software internally in a business, corporate, or commercial setting.
- Use the Software as part of a proprietary workflow or internal system.
- Activate and use all Pro features (e.g., MQTT, CANBus, XY plotting, 3D tools).
- Receive priority technical support via email, GitHub issues, or paid channels.

### 2A. Personal and Evaluation Use (Without a Commercial License)

If you do **not** hold a commercial license, you are granted a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable right to use the official binary **strictly for**:

- **Personal, non-commercial use**, or  
- **Short-term evaluation purposes**

Under this grant:

- Pro features are disabled or gated behind activation.
- You may not use the Software in business, academic, or commercial contexts.
- You may not deploy the Software in production systems, customer-facing tools, or research funded by commercial interests.
- You may not use the Software in any workflow that generates revenue or supports a product/service.

This grant **does not include** the right to redistribute, sublicense, or integrate the Software into any public-facing or monetized system.

## 3. Restrictions

Unless explicitly authorized in writing by the Licensor, you may **not**:

- Redistribute the Software, in whole or in part, modified or unmodified.
- Sublicense, rent, lease, resell, or repackage the Software.
- Reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, or otherwise attempt to extract or alter the Software’s source code or internal behavior.
- Modify, bypass, remove, or disable the activation system or license enforcement mechanisms in any way.
- Attempt to unlock, expose, or enable Pro features without valid activation credentials issued by the Licensor.
- Use the Software in the development of a competing product, or for any purpose that infringes on the Licensor’s intellectual property.

> [!WARNING]
> Any attempt to **bypass activation**, **enable gated features without authorization**, or **tamper with licensing mechanisms** is a direct violation of this Agreement and may result in:
> - **Immediate license termination**
> - **DMCA takedowns**
> - **Legal action for copyright infringement and contract breach**

Violating these terms immediately voids your license and may subject you to civil or criminal penalties under applicable law.

## 4. Term & Termination

This license remains active:

- As long as you hold a valid, paid license, **and**
- You remain in full compliance with this Agreement

The Licensor may terminate this license immediately upon breach. Upon termination, you must **cease all use** and **delete all copies** of the Software.

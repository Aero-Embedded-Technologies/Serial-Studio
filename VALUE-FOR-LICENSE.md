# Earn a Pro License by Contributing

If Serial Studio is useful to you, but you're unable to [purchase a Pro license](https://store.serial-studio.com/), you can **earn one by contributing value** to the project.
This helps make the tool better, more visible, and more sustainable, and gives you full access in return.

Choose any of the following ways to help the project grow:

### üöÄ Make It Known
- Write a post or tutorial about Serial Studio on a developer forum (CSDN, 52pojie, Reddit, etc.)
- Create a short demo video (Bilibili, YouTube, etc.)
- Share on social media or community chats and send proof of reach (engagement, screenshots)

### üî¨ Help Extend Support
- Send binary logs or protocol data for unsupported devices
- Donate development hardware (boards, analyzers, etc.)

### üß© Improve the Tool
- Translate the UI or documentation
- Help write or fix documentation
- Submit pull requests for bug fixes, new features, or platform support

### üéÅ What You‚Äôll Get

Based on your contribution, you‚Äôll receive a **Pro license key** valid for:

| Contribution Type                | License Duration |
|----------------------------------|------------------|
| Forum Post / Tutorial / Video    | 6 months         |
| Hardware Donation                | 12 months        |
| Protocol Log / Sample Data       | 3‚Äì6 months       |
| Translation / Documentation Help | 6‚Äì12 months      |
| Code Contribution                | 6‚Äì12 months      |

> Contributions must be original, useful, and verifiable.

### üß≠ How to Submit

1. **Open a GitHub Discussion** with the `value-for-license` tag  
   - Title: `Request: Pro License via [Your Contribution Type]`
   - Include:
     - What you did (link, file, description, etc.)
     - Email to send the license key

2. **Wait for review.**  
   I‚Äôll respond within a few days. If it checks out, I‚Äôll issue your license.

3. **That's it.**  
   Use the tool fully. Share it further. Help build something better.

### ‚ùó Why This Exists

Serial Studio is built and maintained by one developer.  
I want to keep improving it, but that takes time and real support.

If you can‚Äôt pay, then **contribute.** Help spread the word.

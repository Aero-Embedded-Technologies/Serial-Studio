# [Release 3.1.1 (v3.1.1)](https://github.com/Serial-Studio/Serial-Studio/releases/tag/v3.1.1) - 2025-06-09

Released just hours after v3.1.0, this update adds support for **binary protocol parsing**, no more converting raw bytes to strings before processing.

**Binary (Direct) Decoder:**
You can now select **Binary (Direct)** as a decoder method in the Project Editor.
This passes `QByteArray` data directly to the JavaScript parser, allowing high-performance parsing of binary protocols, including custom formats and raw sensor payloads.

**Technical Benefits:**
- Avoids unnecessary UTF-8, hex, or Base64 conversions.
- Enables use of raw binary frame data in JS scripts.
- Perfect for low-level byte-structured protocols.

**Example use in JS:**

```js
function parse(frame) {
    // Convert each byte to 0‚Äì5V scale
    let volts = [];
    for (let i = 0; i < frame.length; ++i)
        volts.push(frame[i] * 5.0 / 255);
    return volts;
}
```

Existing decoder modes (**Hexadecimal**, **Base64**, and **Plain Text**) continue to convert frame bytes into strings before passing them to JS. This behavior is preserved intentionally to ensure compatibility with all previous projects and scripts.

Only the new **Binary (Direct)** mode bypasses this conversion step and gives full byte-level access.

# [Release v3.0.6](https://github.com/Serial-Studio/Serial-Studio/releases/tag/v3.0.6) - 2024-11-27

### Bug Fix Release

This update addresses a critical crash that occurs immediately after clicking the ‚ÄúOk‚Äù button in this message during startup:

![390274454-f53d3a3d-7fb4-4e91-9f79-816d66c807ee](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ab716ea7-a2c5-49f7-87c5-ebe7c9070c26)

The crash occurs only when Serial Studio is configured to load a saved project file from version 3.0.4 or earlier. Upgrading to this release is strongly recommended to avoid such issues.

In addition to the bug fix, this release introduces an experimental feature related to [#233](https://github.com/Serial-Studio/Serial-Studio/issues/233). Under macOS and Linux, users can now manually specify the serial port device they want to connect to. Please note that this feature is experimental and may not work as expected in all cases.

Given the urgency to prevent crashes for users with saved projects from older versions, this update was prioritized and released quickly. A big thank you to [@tarman3](https://github.com/tarman3) for quickly reporting this issue in [#235](https://github.com/Serial-Studio/Serial-Studio/issues/235).

See all changes: [v3.0.5‚Ä¶v3.0.6](https://github.com/Serial-Studio/Serial-Studio/compare/v3.0.5...v3.0.6)

Thanks, and sorry for the inconvenience!

#### Full Changelog
See all changes: [v3.0.4‚Ä¶v3.0.5](https://github.com/Serial-Studio/Serial-Studio/compare/v3.0.4...v3.0.5)

---

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** The frame parser function format has changed slightly to allow direct specification of a separator sequence within the function implementation. Serial Studio will attempt to automatically update your project if it used the default frame parser function. If you‚Äôve customized the implementation, you‚Äôll need to update the function manually to match the new format. Serial Studio will notify you if this applies.

<a id="v3.0.4"></a>
# [Release v3.0.4](https://github.com/Serial-Studio/Serial-Studio/releases/tag/v3.0.4) - 2024-11-05

Yet another minor bug-fix release. This update smooths out a few issues in the CSV player. Moving backward and forward in plots now works as expected, and you can now use keyboard shortcuts: Space for play/pause, and Left/Right arrows to navigate frames‚Äîjust like in a regular media player. Interval ticks in the plots are also more readable, now preferring integer values over floating points in each tick whenever possible.

For the complete list of changes, please visit: [`v3.0.3...v3.0.4`](https://github.com/Serial-Studio/Serial-Studio/compare/v3.0.3...v3.0.4)

# [Release v3.0.3](https://github.com/Serial-Studio/Serial-Studio/releases/tag/v3.0.3) - 2024-11-04

Another minor bug-fix release. This update resolves an issue where widget or dataset colors would default to black when the dataset index surpassed the available color range in the current theme. With this fix, widget color assignments now loop correctly, ensuring consistent and accurate visual representation across all datasets. Additionally, this release suppresses quick-plot warnings for non-numerical data, minimizing distractions when working with interactive CLI interfaces.

# [Release v2.0.0](https://github.com/Serial-Studio/Serial-Studio/releases/tag/v2.0.0) - 2024-03-21

Hey everyone! I apologize for my limited activity recently. My daily responsibilities have kept me quite busy, leaving me less free time than desired...I've observed that many new issues have emerged from versions 1.1.6 and 1.1.7, and I intend to concentrate on the latest codebase instead of re-directing users to download the continuous release. Wishing all of you the best and thank you for your understanding!

## What's Changed
* Upgraded and renamed the JSON editor to "Project Editor" with newer functionality.
* Introduced a new feature allowing custom parsing code implementation, ideal for processing binary data or handling multiple frame formats within the same project.
* Added support for interacting with Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) devices. Let me know if you are able to plot data from your smartwatch... üòÜ 
* Streamlined the process for selecting device types.
* Implemented other minor user interface enhancements.
* Grammatical and Conciseness Rewording by [@DanPark13](https://github.com/DanPark13) in [#99](https://github.com/Serial-Studio/Serial-Studio/pull/99)
* Update README.md by [@ABHISAHN](https://github.com/ABHISAHN) in [#114](https://github.com/Serial-Studio/Serial-Studio/pull/114)
* add portable application by [@zfb132](https://github.com/zfb132) in [#126](https://github.com/Serial-Studio/Serial-Studio/pull/126)
* update chinese translations by [@zfb132](https://github.com/zfb132) in [#128](https://github.com/Serial-Studio/Serial-Studio/pull/128)
* Update several zh.ts wording by [@Tetrapod1206](https://github.com/Tetrapod1206) in [#179](https://github.com/Serial-Studio/Serial-Studio/pull/179)

‚ö†Ô∏è You **will** need to re-generate your project files, it is **highly** recommended to use the Project Editor instead of editing the JSON code yourself.
